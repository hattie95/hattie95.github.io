            <h3>Thermochemical CO<span>&#8322;</span> Splitting</h3>
            <P>A number of metal oxides and perovskites are capable of being reduced at high temperatures and then re-oxidised in the presence of CO<span>&#8322;</span> or H<span>&#8322;</span>O to form CO or H<span>&#8322;</span>. Barium calcium iron niobates
                have been found to be redox-active in this way. The redox activity of these perovskites was explored, and the chemical and physical stability was investigated using EDX and SEM imaging, respectively. The most promising, Ba<span>&#8322;</span>Ca0.66Nb0.34FeO6-Î´
                (BCNF1), showed mass changes of 0.45 % after five cycles of reduction with N<span>&#8322;</span> and re-oxidation with 10 % CO<span>&#8322;</span>. BCNF1 is chemically stable as it shows no changes in XRD and shows no evidence of sintering,
                although cracking of the pellets was observed after re-oxidation. The low enthalpy of re-oxidation of BCNF1 coupled with the high and sustained mass change makes this perovskite suitable for chemical looping use for energy storage and
                conversion systems. </p>
